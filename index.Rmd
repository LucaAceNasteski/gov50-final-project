## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to basketball, salaries, rankings and statistics. In particular how the top 100 "ranked" players in high-school's salaries turned out, or the longevity of their career in both college and/or the NBA. How many of these players actually make the NBA? How many stay for more than five years? What about the data for those who aren't in the rankings and make the NBA? International? etc.
